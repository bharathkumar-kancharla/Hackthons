# Extract values from Financial Statement documents

Balance Sheet presents the assets, liabilities, and equity of the entity as of the reporting date. Thus, the information 
presented is as of a specific point in time. The report format is structured so that the total of all assets equals the 
total of all liabilities and equity (known as the accounting equation). This is typically considered the second most 
important financial statement, since it provides information about the liquidity and capitalization of an organization. 
You are provided with 2 sample balance sheet documents for reference and 500 balance sheet documents as test 
data. Your task is to extract the values for Year '201 9' only from the test data. 
• If '2019' does not exist in a given balance sheet document, you still need to extract the relevant metrics and 
associate them with an 'NaN' value 

Please refer 'Submission Format' section for more details. 



## Dataset folder comprises of 3 files

  1.** HCL ML Challenge Dataset folder** contains 500 .txt files: you need to train & apply your NLP model on these files 
  2. **Sample Dataset** folder contains 2 sample files for reference and understanding of problem statement 
  3. **sample_submission.csv**  contain the format in which your output file needs to be 
  4. **Results.csv:**  contains expected format of submission file with test data values 


## Submission Format: 
Notes on values to be extracted: 

	- Although the files represent financial statements, the values to be extracted are not numeric for all the  documents. The values can be string ('(%d)','-',etc.) or numeric (%d) 
	- If value extracted is in '(\d+)' format, re-format to '-\d+'. Example: '(23,000)' becomes '-23000' 
	- Some of the balance sheets do not have '2019' column. In such cases, the assets, liabilities, etc. reported need  to be extracted with their corresponding value being "nan" 
	- Replace currency and utf-encoded characters/symbols in the assets column with respective html codes 
	- Your submission record must be convertible to its dictionary representation. You can ensure this by applying `json.loads()` to each entry 
  
  

## Evaluation Criteria: 

Total score is based on number of documents you have successfully extracted the values for: 

`if(actuals_dict[ 'Extracted Values ' ][i]. items() == predicted_dict[ ' Extracted Values ' ] [i] . items()) :
	  score = score+1 `

**Note:**  Uploading source code is mandatory for for manual evaluation of algorithm used.
